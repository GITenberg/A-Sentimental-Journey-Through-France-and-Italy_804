description: "A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy is a novel by Laurence\
  \ Sterne, written and first published in 1768, as Sterne was facing death. In 1765,\
  \ Sterne travelled through France and Italy as far south as Naples, and after returning\
  \ determined to describe his travels from a sentimental point of view. The novel\
  \ can be seen as an epilogue to the possibly unfinished work The Life and Opinions\
  \ of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman, and also as an answer to Tobias Smollett's decidedly\
  \ unsentimental Travels through France and Italy. Sterne had met Smollett during\
  \ his travels in Europe, and strongly objected to his spleen, acerbity and quarrelsomeness.\
  \ He modeled the character of Smelfungus on him.\nThe novel was extremely popular\
  \ and influential and helped establish travel writing as the dominant genre of the\
  \ second half of the 18th century. Unlike prior travel accounts which stressed classical\
  \ learning and objective non-personal points of view, A Sentimental Journey emphasized\
  \ the subjective discussions of personal taste and sentiments, of manners and morals\
  \ over classical learning. Throughout the 1770s female travel writers began publishing\
  \ significant numbers of sentimental travel accounts. Sentiment also became a favorite\
  \ style among those expressing non-mainstream views including political radicalism.\n\
  The narrator is the Reverend Mr. Yorick, who is slyly represented to guileless readers\
  \ as Sterne's barely disguised alter ego. The book recounts his various adventures,\
  \ usually of the amorous type, in a series of self-contained episodes. The book\
  \ is less eccentric and more elegant in style than Tristram Shandy and was better\
  \ received by contemporary critics. It was published on 27 February, and on 18 March\
  \ Sterne died.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
